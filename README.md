## Warning!

snake is not feature complete. It is not recommended that you use it for your bots.

## Getting Started

```js
const { CommandClient } = require('discord.js-snake');

let client = new CommandClient({ prefix: '?' });

// Add a command.
client.command('ship', '<x:member> <y:member>', (ctx, x, y) => {
  ctx.send(`A lovely pairing~ ${x.displayName} ‚ô•Ô∏è ${y.displayName}`);
}, 'Ship people.');

// Login!
client.login('...');
```
